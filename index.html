   ============================ */
const amscoSummaries = {
 "columbian exchange":"Great question! The Columbian Exchange was the massive swap of plants, animals, and diseases after 1492. Europe gained foods like corn and potatoes, while the Americas got wheat, sugar, horses—and devastating diseases. It permanently reshaped diets, populations, and power across the Atlantic world.",
 "christopher columbus":"Columbus, backed by Spain in 1492, sailed west looking for Asia but landed in the Americas. Even though he misidentified the lands and peoples, his voyages opened permanent contact between Europe and the New World. That contact launched colonization, conquest, and a global transformation.",
 "spanish conquest":"Spain’s early dominance came from bold expeditions and conquests—Cortés over the Aztecs and Pizarro over the Incas—sending shiploads of gold and silver home. Wealth and power surged, encouraging more colonization. These empires also set up systems to control labor and extract resources.",
 "encomienda":"Under encomienda, Spanish settlers received land and the right to Indigenous labor and tribute. In practice, it often meant harsh exploitation, despite claims of 'protection' and conversion. As disease and abuse reduced native populations, Spain increasingly imported enslaved Africans.",
 "asiento":"The asiento was Spain’s licensed system to import enslaved Africans to the Americas for a royal tax. It grew as Native populations declined. It tied Atlantic economies together in a tragic, profit-driven traffic in human beings.",
 "bartolome de las casas":"Las Casas started as a colonist but became a fierce critic of Native mistreatment. He pushed reforms like the New Laws (1542) to curb slavery and forced labor. Resistance by colonists blunted changes, but his voice shaped debates about empire and morality.",
 "english policy toward natives":"Early on, some English colonies traded and cooperated with Native groups, but pressures for land quickly drove conflict. Unlike Spanish rule over large empires, English settlers often displaced smaller tribes. The result was recurring warfare and Native migration inland.",
 "native reaction":"Native peoples responded in different ways—alliances, trade, warfare, and migration—to survive disease, violence, and colonization. Because tribes acted separately, European powers often avoided a unified resistance. Indigenous strategies adapted continually to new realities.",
 "jamestown":"Jamestown nearly failed from disease, starvation, and poor organization. John Smith’s strict rules and John Rolfe’s tobacco crop helped it survive. Eventually, the crown took over, making Virginia England’s first royal colony.",
 "mayflower compact":"The Mayflower Compact was a simple but important agreement among Plymouth settlers to form a government and obey its rules. It’s an early example of self-government by consent. That tradition grows stronger in New England town meetings.",
 "plymouth":"Plymouth struggled through its first winter, then stabilized with Native help and a mixed economy based on fish, furs, and lumber. It stayed small compared to Massachusetts Bay. Its legacy is strong on community and covenant.",
 "massachusetts bay puritans":"Puritans hoped to purify the Church of England and build a godly 'city upon a hill.' They created congregational churches and local town meetings. Religious zeal brought community cohesion—but also intolerance for dissent.",
 "great migration":"Political turmoil in England sent thousands of Puritans to Massachusetts in the 1630s. The influx boosted towns, churches, and local governance. It helped make New England unusually stable and family-centered.",
 "roger williams":"Williams championed freedom of conscience and fair dealings with Native peoples. Banished from Massachusetts, he founded Providence (Rhode Island) with remarkable religious toleration. It became a refuge for dissenters of many kinds.",
 "anne hutchinson":"Hutchinson argued that faith alone—not works—was necessary for salvation, challenging Puritan leaders. Banished from Massachusetts, she helped found Portsmouth (later part of Rhode Island). Her story highlights conflicts over authority and religious freedom.",
 "fundamental orders of connecticut":"These were among the first written constitutions in America (1639). They set up a representative government with elected legislators and governor. It’s a building block in the tradition of self-rule.",
 "king philip’s war":"Metacom (King Philip) led a Native alliance against expanding English settlements (1675–76). The war was brutal and costly on both sides; colonists ultimately prevailed, breaking major Native resistance in New England. It marked a turning point in regional power.",
 "new york (duke of york)":"England seized New Amsterdam from the Dutch and renamed it New York. The crown tried to rule without an assembly, but colonists pushed back—early evidence that English settlers expected representation. Eventually, civil rights and an assembly were restored.",
 "new jersey":"New Jersey began as two proprietary colonies with generous land grants and religious toleration, then merged into a royal colony. Conflicting land claims and frequent ownership changes created confusion. Unification helped stabilize governance.",
 "quakers and william penn":"Quakers believed in equality, inner light, and pacifism—radical ideas for the time. William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a 'holy experiment' with elected assemblies, religious liberty, and fair treatment of Natives. It attracted diverse settlers and grew quickly.",
 "south carolina rice economy":"South Carolina shifted from provisioning the West Indies to rice and indigo plantations worked by enslaved Africans. Its economy and culture resembled the Caribbean more than New England. Slavery became central.",
 "georgia oglethorpe":"Georgia started as a philanthropic buffer colony against Spanish Florida, banning rum and slavery early on. It struggled under the rules and constant security pressure. Over time, restrictions eased and the colony aligned with southern patterns.",
 "mercantilism":"Mercantilism said colonies existed to enrich the mother country through controlled trade. England’s Navigation Acts steered commerce on English ships and through English ports. Colonists benefited in some ways but resented limits and costs.",
 "navigation acts":"These laws required English/colonial ships and routed goods through England; certain 'enumerated' goods could go only to England. New England shipbuilding thrived, but manufacturing was constrained and smuggling spread. Tensions simmered under lax enforcement.",
 "dominion of new england":"James II combined several colonies under Governor Andros, limiting town meetings and altering land titles to tighten royal control. The Glorious Revolution toppled him and ended the Dominion. Colonies regained separate charters, but imperial ambitions remained.",
 "triangular trade":"New England rum to Africa, enslaved people to the West Indies (Middle Passage), sugar back to New England. Each leg aimed at profit. It tied the Atlantic economies together, with immense human cost.",
 "population growth and diversity":"By 1775, the colonial population soared to ~2.5 million, fueled by immigration and high birthrates. Germans, Scots-Irish, and others added diversity, especially in the Middle Colonies and backcountry. Africans—free and enslaved—made up about 20%.",
 "self-government":"Most colonies had elected assemblies that approved taxes. Governors were often appointed by crown or proprietor, but local legislatures held the purse strings. This nurtured habits of representation and debate.",
 "religion and established churches":"Protestant groups dominated but varied by region. Over time, states reduced tax support for established churches, with RI and PA especially tolerant. Disestablishment grew after independence.",
 "enlightenment locke":"Enlightenment thinkers emphasized reason, natural rights, and consent of the governed. Locke argued people could change governments that violated rights. These ideas influenced revolutionary leaders and the founding.",
 "regional economies":"New England: mixed economy with small farms, shipping, lumber, and rum. Middle Colonies: grains, ironwork, and growing towns. South: plantations (tobacco, rice, indigo) with enslaved labor; many small farmers too.",
 "local government models":"New England centered on town meetings and direct voting. The South used counties with sheriffs and appointed officials. These patterns shaped local political culture.",
 "voting and limits":"Participation expanded for white male property holders, but many were still excluded—women, most free Blacks, enslaved people, and the poor. Even with limits, colonial politics leaned more participatory than Europe.",
 "french and indian war overview":"Britain and France fought for control of North America; early British setbacks gave way to victories under Pitt. The 1763 Peace of Paris handed Britain French Canada and Spanish Florida. War debts and new responsibilities pushed Britain to tax and regulate the colonies.",
 "albany plan of union":"Franklin proposed a joint colonial council for defense and taxation in 1754. Colonies rejected it to keep local control. Still, it foreshadowed later intercolonial cooperation.",
 "british vs colonial views after 1763":"Britain doubted colonial military reliability and resented poor support. Colonists felt proud and capable—and unimpressed with British tactics in American terrain. The 'victory' exposed expectations on both sides.",
 "pontiac’s rebellion":"A Native alliance attacked forts and settlements after 1763, angered by land grabs and changed diplomacy. Britain sent regular troops to suppress it. The crisis helped prompt the Proclamation Line.",
 "proclamation of 1763":"Britain barred settlement west of the Appalachians to reduce frontier conflict. Colonists—eager for land—resented the limit and often ignored it. It became an early flashpoint over imperial authority.",
 "sugar act":"The Sugar Act lowered the molasses duty but cracked down on smuggling with stricter enforcement and admiralty courts. Colonists noticed the revenue motive. It signaled a new approach after salutary neglect.",
 "quartering act":"Colonies were required to house and supply British troops. Many saw it as intrusive and a burden. It fueled suspicions about standing armies in peacetime.",
 "stamp act":"This 1765 direct tax on printed materials hit everyday life—newspapers, legal papers, cards. Protests, boycotts, the Sons/Daughters of Liberty, and the Stamp Act Congress built intercolonial unity. Pressure worked—Parliament repealed it in 1766.",
 "declaratory act":"Parliament repealed the Stamp Act but asserted full authority to legislate for the colonies 'in all cases whatsoever.' It planted the seed for the next conflicts.",
 "townshend acts":"Duties on glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea—with revenues paying royal officials—reduced colonial leverage. Writs of assistance allowed broad searches. Boycotts returned; smuggling persisted.",
 "massachusetts circular letter":"Otis and Samuel Adams urged colonies to petition repeal of Townshend duties. Britain threatened the legislature and sent more troops to Boston. Resistance spread through intercolonial communication.",
 "boston massacre":"Tension in Boston boiled over in 1770; soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five. John Adams defended them at trial; Samuel Adams used the event as propaganda. It rallied Patriot sentiment.",
 "committees of correspondence":"Local and intercolonial committees shared news and coordinated responses. They kept the cause alive during quiet periods. This network was crucial for unity.",
 "gaspee incident":"Rhode Islanders burned a hated customs ship; Britain threatened to try suspects in England. It heightened fears of lost jury trials and arbitrary power.",
 "tea act":"Parliament made BEIC tea cheaper—even with the tax—to undercut smuggling. Colonists saw it as a trick to accept Parliament’s right to tax. Resistance held firm.",
 "boston tea party":"Disguised colonists dumped tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. Some cheered; others worried it went too far. Britain responded with hardline measures.",
 "intolerable acts":"The Coercive Acts punished Massachusetts—closing the port, reshaping the government, expanding quartering—and the Quebec Act extended Quebec to the Ohio and recognized Catholicism. Colonists saw a threat to rights and western claims.",
 "first continental congress":"Delegates endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, declared colonial rights, and formed The Association to enforce boycotts. Most weren’t seeking independence yet—just restoration of rights.",
 "lexington and concord":"British troops marched to seize supplies; militia met them at Lexington and then harassed them back from Concord. 'The shot heard ’round the world' started the war.",
 "bunker hill":"Americans fortified Breed’s Hill; the British took it at high cost. Colonists proved they could stand up to regulars. It boosted Patriot morale.",
 "second continental congress":"Congress organized the war, chose Washington, and sent the Olive Branch Petition. The king rejected it and cut off trade—the break widened.",
 "olive branch petition and prohibitory act":"Colonists appealed for reconciliation; the king refused and labeled them in rebellion. Trade was banned—pushing moderates toward independence.",
 "common sense":"Thomas Paine argued clearly for independence and a republic—no more monarchy. It reached ordinary readers and shifted public opinion.",
 "patriots and loyalists":"Support split; many Patriots came from New England and Virginia, while Loyalists were strong in NY/NJ/GA. Many people tried to stay out of it altogether.",
 "articles of confederation":"The first U.S. framework created a weak central government with a one-house Congress—no tax power and limited enforcement. Cooperation was hard; amending required unanimity.",
 "northwest ordinance":"Congress set rules for territories to become states and banned slavery in the Northwest Territory. It supported education and civil liberties. It was a major success under the Articles.",
 "shays’ rebellion":"Debt-ridden farmers in Massachusetts rose up over taxes and foreclosures. The uprising exposed the Articles’ weakness in crises. It helped spur calls to strengthen the government.",
 "social change after revolution":"Titles and primogeniture faded; church-state separation advanced; women kept farms and shops running during the war. Slavery was questioned, restricted in the North—but expanded and defended in much of the South."
